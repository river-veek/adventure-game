# Python Text-Based Adventure Game
Fight enemies, find and trade items, and defeat a final boss to win!

This project displays a culmination of Python skills that I have learned in CIS 122, 210, and 211 at UofO.

## Getting Started
To start the game, run the following command:
```
python adventure_V3.py
```

Once the game is running, following the onscreen instructions. 
To move your character, select the direction you would like to go ("w", "a", "s", or "d") followed by the enter key.
