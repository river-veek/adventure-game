# Python Text-Based Adventure Game
Fight enemies, find and trade items, and defeat a final boss to win!

This project displays a culmination of Python skills that I have learned in CIS 122, 210, and 211 at UofO.

## Getting Started
To start the game, run the following command:
```
python adventure_V3.py
```

Once the game is running, following the onscreen instructions. 
To move your character, select the direction you would like to go ("w", "a", "s", or "d") followed by the <enter> key.
